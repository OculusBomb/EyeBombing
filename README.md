### This project has helped us see every day objects in a different way, going around the local area and realising how many objects we can relate to the human face and seeing different human features. We have learnt alot about the way we see and how we an incorprate that into our design thinking.

##Callum's Images

Below are my favourite photos that I have taken for this project, I have taken them in a few places to mix up the kind of images I get and I think they came out really well! The project made me think about the surroundings that I look at on a day to day basis, going home or walking around London I was able to see face's in things I would not normally even look at. The images I took did not need any editing as I framed all my images well so there was no need for cropping ort rotating! 

The images below consist of photos around:

* North Greenwich area (1,5,6,7) 
* My House (2,3,9,10)
* My Workplace (4)
* Kesington (8)

##Emma's Initial Images

Below are the original images that I took before cropping or altering them. I started off with just taking pictures around Greenwich and the university but they were similar to images that other groups also had. Therefor I decided to find faces around the house. Some of them are harder to tell where the face is than others, I need to ensure that I crop them or rotate to make the face easier to spot!

##Emma's Cropped/Altered Images

A couple of the images below visibally shows a face without me having to crop them. For the other ones I have cropped them slightly enabaling anyone to see the face. Also, with two of the pictures I have had to rotate them so that the face is the right way up.

##Emma's Top 3

These pictures are my favourite three. The faces in these images aren't the normal ones you can see in the others. I love the expressions of image 1 & 3 and number 3 looks like it has hair as well. Additionally, image 2 was one of my favourites as I spotted that there would be a face before it happened. So I waited until the carts lined up with the lampost to make a face.
