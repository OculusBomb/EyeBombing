# Closure & Symmetry and Order
=============

## Closure 
> “When seeing a complex arrangement of elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.”

![Alt text](/Misc_Photos/02-closure.png "Example Of Closure")

Closure can be thought of as the glue holding elements together. It’s about the human tendency to seek and find patterns.
The key to closure is providing enough information so the eye can fill in the rest. If too much is missing, the elements will be seen as separate parts instead of a whole. If too much information is provided, there’s no need for closure to occur.

##Symmetry 
>Symmetry gives us a feeling of solidity and order, which we tend to seek. It’s our nature to impose order on chaos. This principle leads us to want balance in composition, though our compositions don’t need to be perfectly symmetrical to be in balance.
